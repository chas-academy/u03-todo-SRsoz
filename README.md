# How to run my application

Here is a step by step on how to run the application:
1.Clone this repository from GitHub to your local machine
2.Build a docker container in docker desktop by running the command "docker compose up" in the terminal
3.When the build is finished you can reach the application by typing **localhost** in your URL or clicking 80:80 in docker desktop
4.To shut down the application run the "docker compose down" command in the terminal. If you only want to stop the container from running you can press the "stop" button in docker desktop.

## PSR12

My code follows the PSR12 standard. Although there was an error that I wasn't able to fix, even after googling, asking a couple of classmates and trying to figure it out myself. The error said "expected 1 space after closing brace; newline found" but I couldn't seem to find the newline / whitespace issue. Other then that my code follows the standard.

## Comments

I would like to mention that I did want to split my work into multiple files. But when I thought of this I had already finished most of my code and I couldn't split it like I wanted to because it created errors since I already started with the styling. At least I did split the files that I was able to.
